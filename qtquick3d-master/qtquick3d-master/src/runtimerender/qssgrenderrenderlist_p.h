/**
 * The render list exists so that dependencies of the main render target can render themselves
 * completely before the main render target renders.  From Maxwell GPU's on, we have a tiled
 * architecture.  This tiling mechanism is sensitive to switching the render target, so we would
 * really like to render completely to a single render target and then switch.  With our layered
 * render architecture, this is not very feasible unless dependencies render themselves before
 * the main set of layers render themselves.  Furthermore it benefits the overall software
 * architecture to have a distinct split between the prepare for render step and the render step
 * and using this render list allows us to avoid some level of repeated tree traversal at the cost
 * of some minimal per frame allocation.  The rules for using the render list are that you need to
 * add yourself before your dependencies do; the list is iterated in reverse during RunRenderTasks.
 * So a layer adds itself (if it is going to render offscreen) before it runs through its renderable
 * list to prepare each object because it is during the renderable prepare traversale that
 * subpresentations will get added by the offscreen render manager.
